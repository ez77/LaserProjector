## Laser Projector with Arduino 

In this project a simple laser projector was developed using an Arduino uno. The projector works in 3 different modes, automatic mode, user-defined path mode and pattern selection mode. The goal of the project was to exploit a digital logic framework in order to make the projector work by at least showing some geometric patterns or draw simple user-defined vector graphics.
